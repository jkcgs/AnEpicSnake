AnEpicSnake
===========

This is just an epic snake game. Don't play it if you're epileptic. Really..

To control the snake use WASD.
To pause the game use RETURN key (a.k.a ENTER)

Programmed using the SDL2 v2.0.3 library with SDL2_image v2.0.0 and SDL2_mixer 2.0.0. 
I have built it on Windows 8.1 x64 using VS2013 (project included).

You should be able to compile it on linux and/or mac with mentioned libraries.
