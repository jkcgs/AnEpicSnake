Programmed using the SDL2 v2.0.3 library with SDL2_image v2.0.0. 
I have built it on Windows 8.1 x64 using NetBeans, and compiled with mingw32
using -mwindows flag, and -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image compiler flags.

You should be able to compile it on linux and/or mac with mentioned libraries.
